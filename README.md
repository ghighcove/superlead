A comprehensive scientific autonomous projectile guidance research platform designed for non-military applications including atmospheric research, materials testing, and autonomous systems development.

## 🎯 Research Focus

**Non-Military Scientific Applications**:
- Atmospheric research and weather monitoring
- Materials science testing and analysis
- Autonomous systems research and development
- Ballistics research for scientific purposes
- Academic research and educational applications

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### Core Technical Documents
- **[System Architecture](docs/system_architecture.md)** - Five-layer design and component integration
- **[Commercial Options](docs/commercial_options.md)** - Cost-effective drone platform analysis
- **[Adversarial Threats](docs/adversarial_threats.md)** - Security analysis and countermeasures
- **[Mathematical Framework](docs/mathematical_framework.md)** - Theoretical foundation and algorithms
- **[Technical Specifications](docs/technical_specifications.md)** - Hardware specs and APIs

### Quick Start

🚀 **Automatic Session Ingestion (Recommended)**

**Windows:**
```cmd
start_session.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./start_session.sh
```

This automatically scans for new research sources, analyzes relevance, and provides documentation integration recommendations.

## 🔬 Source Integration System

The system includes an automated research integration framework that:

1. **Monitors** `input/` directory for new research sources
2. **Processes** academic papers, briefings, and data files
3. **Analyzes** relevance using intelligent keyword matching
4. **Suggests** integration points and documentation updates
5. **Tracks** all sources with version control and citation management

### Adding Research Sources

**Automatic Ingestion**: Place files in `input/` directory and start new session

**Manual Integration**:
```bash
python source_manager.py
```

**Input Structure**:
```
input/
├── papers/          # Academic papers (.pdf, .txt)
├── briefings/       # Research summaries (.md)
├── data/           # Research data (.json, .csv)
└── references/     # Citations and sources (.md)
```
