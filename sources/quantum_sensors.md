## Key Findings
- Quantum entanglement sensors provide 10x accuracy improvement over traditional GPS
- Cold atom interferometers enable cm-level navigation without satellite signals
- Quantum gravimeters can detect underground structures for navigation waypoints

## Technical Specifications
- Accuracy: 1cm (compared to 1-5m for GPS)
- Update rate: 100Hz
- Power consumption: 50W (vs 10W for GPS)
- Cost: $10,000 per unit (vs $100 for GPS)

## Integration Recommendations
This research is directly applicable to:
- Perception Layer sensor fusion
- Navigation systems in GPS-denied environments
- Adversarial threat mitigation
