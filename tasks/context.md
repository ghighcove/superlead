## Important Notes

### 2-Action Rule
**After every 2 view/browser/search operations, update this file**
- Multimodal content doesn't persist in context
- Visual information must be captured as text immediately
- Write down discoveries before they're lost

### Context Window Management
- This file is the single source of truth for session state
- Archive old sections to `tasks/archive/` when starting new major phases
- Keep "Current Status" and "5-Question Context Check" always up-to-date
- Historical phases preserved for reference but don't need frequent updates

### Safety Reminders
- All research for non-military scientific purposes only
- Comply with aviation and communications regulations
- Prioritize safety in all design decisions
- Document all safety considerations thoroughly
