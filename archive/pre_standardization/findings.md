# Project SUPERLEAD - Findings & Decisions: Adversarial Technologies Research
<!-- 
  WHAT: Knowledge base for adversarial technologies research on autonomous projectile guidance systems
  WHY: Context windows are limited. This file stores critical threat intelligence and analysis.
  WHEN: Update after ANY discovery, especially after 2 view/browser/search operations (2-Action Rule).
-->

## Requirements
<!-- 
  WHAT: Specific research requirements from user request
  WHY: Keeps research scope visible and ensures comprehensive coverage
-->
<!-- Captured from user request -->
- Research adversarial technologies affecting autonomous projectile guidance systems
- Focus on 5 key areas: Electronic warfare, Cybersecurity, Environmental hazards, Physical countermeasures, Regulatory constraints
- Create comprehensive analysis covering: specific disruptive technologies, mitigation strategies, risk assessment matrix, safety protocols, detection methods
- Include current state-of-the-art countermeasures and best practices

## Research Findings
<!-- 
  WHAT: Key discoveries from web searches, documentation reading, or exploration
  WHY: Multimodal content doesn't persist. Write it down immediately.
  WHEN: After EVERY 2 view/browser/search operations, update this section (2-Action Rule).
-->
<!-- Key discoveries during exploration -->
- Initial research framework established with systematic threat categorization
- Planning documents created for comprehensive research approach
- 8-phase research methodology defined for thorough coverage

### Electronic Warfare Threats (Phase 2 Research)
- GPS jamming and spoofing identified as primary battlefield threats in 2025
- HIMARS and artillery systems being retrofitted with GPS protections due to Ukraine war experience
- Advanced Navigation introducing EP (Electronic Protection) range for defense-ready INS systems
- FAA releasing GNSS Interference Resource Guide (Version 1.0, Dec 2025)
- ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) becoming critical for autonomous vehicle navigation
- Solid-state gyroscopes potentially rendering traditional GPS jamming obsolete
- LiDAR perception systems vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks (arXiv paper, Sep 2024)

### Cybersecurity Threats (Phase 3 Research)  
- Data poisoning attacks emerging as significant threat to Intelligent Transportation Systems
- Partial-information cyber attacks targeting autonomous vehicle sensing systems via firmware/driver level malware
- AI security risks expanding to include agentic AI solutions as targets in 2025
- Longitudinal cyber attacks identified that lack situational awareness but can disrupt safety-critical sensing
- 2025 threat landscape includes internet balkanization affecting autonomous systems
- Vision-based autonomous systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks across full stack and life-cycle

### Physical Countermeasures & Detection (Phase 4 Research)
- CISA released UAS Detection Technology Guidance for Critical Infrastructure (August 2025)
- MITRE analysis positions counter-autonomy as economic and security advantage for U.S.
- AI integration in physical security reaching 22% adoption rate for threat detection and prediction
- Vision-based autonomous systems require comprehensive defense mechanisms against adversarial threats
- Taxonomy developed for securing autonomous systems against physical and cyber threats
- Counter-UAS systems distinction made from pure detection technology

### Environmental & Operational Hazards (Phase 5 Research)
- Deep learning methods for automatic environmental hazard recognition in river/lake ecosystems (2025)
- Drone disturbance impact on wildlife identified as operational concern with species-specific sensitivities
- Climate-relevant robotics research roadmap identifies high-impact opportunities for climate-autonomy intersection
- Wildlife responses to drone operations include vigilance, flight responses, and physiological stress
- Environmental factors (altitude, speed, noise, visual stimuli) significantly influence autonomous system performance

### Regulatory & Legal Constraints (Phase 6 Research)
- UN General Assembly resolution on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (Dec 2024) - 166 votes in favor
- Human Rights Watch report identifies autonomous weapons as hazard to human rights (April 2025)
- Two-tier approach emerging: prohibit some LAWS while regulating others under international law
- EU AI Act excludes military and security applications from scope
- No single global regulation exists - patchwork of partial legal frameworks across jurisdictions
- Meaningful human control requirement becoming central to international treaty discussions

## Technical Decisions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Research methodology and structure choices with reasoning
  WHY: Preserves research approach justification and ensures systematic coverage
-->
<!-- Decisions made with rationale -->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Systematic threat categorization | Ensures comprehensive coverage across all attack vectors |
| 8-phase research approach | Breaks complex research into manageable, sequential phases |
| Focus on current state-of-the-art | Provides immediately actionable intelligence |
| Include mitigation strategies | Makes research useful for system designers and engineers |

## Issues Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Research challenges and data gaps
  WHY: Documents obstacles and solutions for continuous improvement
-->
<!-- Errors and how they were resolved -->
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| PowerShell syntax error in session catchup | Used direct file creation instead of script execution |

## Resources
<!-- 
  WHAT: Research sources and reference materials
  WHY: Easy reference for citation and further research
-->
<!-- URLs, file paths, API references -->
- Planning templates: C:\Users\ghigh\.config\opencode\skills\planning-with-files\templates\
- Research plan: C:\ai\superlead\task_plan.md

## Visual/Browser Findings
<!-- 
  WHAT: Information learned from viewing images, PDFs, or browser results
  WHY: CRITICAL - Visual/multimodal content doesn't persist in context. Must be captured as text.
  WHEN: IMMEDIATELY after viewing images or browser results. Don't wait!
-->
<!-- CRITICAL: Update after every 2 view/browser operations -->
<!-- Multimodal content must be captured as text immediately -->
- Research planning template structure reviewed and adapted for adversarial technology analysis
- File organization strategy established for comprehensive threat research
